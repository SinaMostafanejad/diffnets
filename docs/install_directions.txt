*Go to directory you would like diffnets (and enspara) to live in*

cd /desired/path/for/packages

*Create a conda environment that will be used for diffnets*

conda create --name diffnets python=3.6

*Enter this conda environment and install enspara*

conda activate diffnets

git clone https://github.com/bowman-lab/enspara

conda install -c conda-forge mdtraj=1.8.0

conda install numpy==1.14

conda install cython

conda install mpi4py -c conda-forge

cd enspara

pip install -e .

*Check that enspara was installed successfully*

cd /any/random/directory

python

import enspara

*Great! Now you have enspara installed, which is a dependency of diffnets but is also great on it's own for clustering and building MSMs.*

*Return to /desired/path/for/packages and download diffnets*

cd /desired/path/for/packages

git clone https://github.com/bowman-lab/diffnets

*Install pytorch*

*If you are installing on a mac or CPU only machine use this command. Note: Trainingis much slower on CPUs

conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch

*If you are installing on a cuda enabled GPU you will need cuda installed. Recommended to use cuda 10.1*

conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch

*Install click*

conda install click

*Install diffnets*

cd diffnets

pip install -e .

*Check that diffnets was installed successfully*

cd /any/random/directory

python

import diffnets

*You now have diffnets installed. When using diffnets, remember to be in the proper conda environment! For example, run this before using diffnets*

conda activate diffnets
